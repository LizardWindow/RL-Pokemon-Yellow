Can use YellowMultiEnv to train the model

Use YellowPlaySolo to play the game without a model
This file is outdated code that was just quickly changed to make it work for obtaining states by playing the game myself

YellowTestModel will allow you to test various models out by selecting them with the variable on line 107

Requires a copy of Pokemon Yellow in the top directory named PokemonYellowVersion.gb
